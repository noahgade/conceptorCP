Estimates of significance are obtained with a moving block bootstrap, and the assumption is an initial section of data at least wide-sense stationary, or it does not exhibit some long run trend.

## Example Data

Package includes one example VAR1 data set, `test_data`. Description of its generation is included in the documentation files.
